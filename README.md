Examples of game blanks using the pygame library, for beginners. 

In these examples, I did not use classes, complex data structures, and all the code for each blank is contained in a single file. 

You can freely use the code in your projects. If you plan to use music and sprites as well, then follow the licenses for the files specified in the "Attribution" file
